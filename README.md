# Working-with-Streamlit
This repository showcases my work in Streamlit. 
This also shows my steps towards deployment. 

Streamlit is an open-source framework designed to create interactive and visually appealing web applications for data science and machine learning projects with minimal effort. It was created by Adrien Treuille, Thiago Teixeira, and Amanda Kelly, and released in 2019. Streamlit allows developers to turn data scripts into shareable web apps in a few simple steps.

**Key Features of Streamlit:**
Easy to Use: Streamlit is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing developers to build and deploy applications with only a few lines of Python code.

Interactive Widgets: Streamlit provides a wide range of built-in widgets, such as sliders, buttons, file uploaders, and more, to create interactive user interfaces effortlessly.

Real-Time Updates: Streamlit apps can automatically update in real-time as the underlying data or code changes, providing an interactive and dynamic user experience.

No Web Development Required: Streamlit abstracts away the complexities of web development, allowing data scientists and engineers to focus on their data and models without needing expertise in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Seamless Integration: Streamlit integrates well with popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and more, making it easy to visualize and manipulate data.

**Advantages of Streamlit:**
